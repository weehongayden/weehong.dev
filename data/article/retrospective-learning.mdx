## Review Tips

1. Write to-do list daily
   <br />
   5 ~ 10 items include work, study or life chores
2. Prepare a timer
   <br />
   Track your task with a timer to understand the time taken to complete a task. It helps to better gauge the number of tasks being completed in a day.
   <br />
   **(Procrastination leads to anxiety, and anxiety is caused by losing control)**
3. Review the to-do list by the end of the day
   <br />
   Summarize and find the regularity
   (Eg: what activity is causing the waste of time)
4. **Not only review the bad, but also the good**
   <br />
   (Eg: Achieve things, write down what has been executed or reason)
5. **Read the review periodically**
   <br />
   (Eg: Read the review on the next day, weekly, biweekly or monthly)
