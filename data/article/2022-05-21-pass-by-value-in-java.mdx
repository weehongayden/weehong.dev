## Pass by value
As long as it comes to Java, everything is **pass-by-value** as an argument.
However, some developers might aware the value was changed after exiting the function.

## Stack and Heap Memory
Based on what has been written in [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-pass-by-value-or-pass-by-reference) article, 
- the **primitive variable** stores directly at the stack memory
- the **non-primitive variable** or **object** stored in the heap memory.

### Primitive Variable
The lifespan of the primitive variable in the method/function only lasts until the scope end.

The value will be reset once exiting the method/function.

```java
public class Primitive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 1;
        int y = 1;
        
        System.out.println(x); // 1
        System.out.println(y); // 1
        
        change(x, y);
    
        System.out.println(x); // 1
        System.out.println(y); // 1
    }    
    
    public static void change(int x, int y) {
        x = 5;
        y = 10;
        
        System.out.println(x); // 5
        System.out.println(y); // 10
    }
}
```

### Object Variable
It is unique when it comes to objects. A new variable will be created and points to the same memory address when an object is passing as an argument.

As a result, the modified value of the property will also be reflected on the original object.

However, when a new object has been initialized, the lifespan of the object only exists within the scope, and the change of the value will only remain within the method/function scope.

```java
public class Object {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a = new int[1];
        int[] b = new int[1];
        a[0] = 1;
        b[0] = 1;
        
        System.out.println(a[0]); // 1
        System.out.println(b[0]); // 1

        change(a, b);

        System.out.println(a[0]); // 10
        System.out.println(b[0]); // 1
    }

    public static void change(int[] a, int[] b) {
        a[0] = 10;
        b = new int[1];
        b[0] = 20;

        System.out.println(a[0]); // 10
        System.out.println(b[0]); // 20
    }
}
```
## Conclusion
We have learned the parameter of Java is always pass-by-value, but it is slightly different when it comes to primitive and object.

Primitive and object references are always passed by value, but the object's property value will remain once changed.
