## LeetCode Grinding or Review Tips

```js showLineNumbers
(async(() => {
  console.log("Hello, World")
})()
```

1. Solve at least one question daily
   <br />
   Pick a question and solve it everyday.
   <br />
   [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) is one of the great resources
   to start.

     Tips for beginner,
     <br />I strongly recommend to solve the question by tag. Choose the question
     with same tags but different algorithms.
   </Callout>
2. Prepare a timer
   <br />
   Track the time to complete a task with a timer. It helps to better gauge the time
   needed to solve the question and understand the strength and weakness.
   <br />
   **(Procrastination leads to anxiety, and anxiety is caused by losing control)**
3. Review the question by the end of the day / next day
   <br />
   Summarize and find the regularity or patterns.
   <br />
   - Where do you stuck? 
     <br />
     It might because lack of the knowledge of using certain algorithms?
   - Why are you stuck?
     <br />
     It might because lack of understand of the question or data structure?
   - How to improve the algorithms?
     <br />
     Maybe you are writing a brute force solution, and perhaps can improve it?
   - How to better avoid bugs?
     <br />
     You have more than 2 submissions failed not because of your answer, but your syntax or wrong variable naming?
   - How to improve your coding style for better understanding?
     <br />
     Perhaps you should avoid using `a` and `b` as your variable name. You are not doing competitive programming but writing the code for your interviewer to understand.
4. **Not only review the weakness, but also the strength**
   <br />
   Always review the weakness will demotivate you and pass over your strength.
   (Eg: Solved the question within 20 minutes, write down what has been executed, though process and how you did it)
5. **Read the review periodically**
   <br />
   Read the review on the next day, weekly, biweekly or monthly.
