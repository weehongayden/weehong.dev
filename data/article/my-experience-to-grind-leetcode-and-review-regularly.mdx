title: "5 Steps to Improve Steadily at LeetCode by Reviewing Your Learning Periodically"
description: "As a software engineer, we always want to get good at problem solving at LeetCode because it helps us to get into our dream company. However, we might find ourselves remain stagnant after solving hundreds of questions and here the 5 steps to guide developer who wanting to learn and improving steadily at LeetCode."

I believe some software engineers who grind the LeetCode might find themselves not improving after solving many questions.

Well, at least for me. I felt frustrated because I was not improving after solving hundreds of questions and was stuck solving a Medium question.

I have been told that I learn in the wrong way after consulting with those gurus who constantly share their thoughts and solutions on LeetCode.

They share their ways of learning as shown below,

1. Solve at least one question with a specific tag daily
   <br />
   You have to solve a question with a specific tag daily until you are comfortable with the type of questions.
   <br />
   E.g., I am weak to DFS type of question, so I keep practicing the DFS question and I will switch to the Medium difficulty once I can solve the easy question within an amount of time.
   <br />
   **Tips:** [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) is one of the great resources to start.
   <Callout emoji="üì£">
     <p>Try to avoid to solve the question with similar solution.</p>
     <p>E.g., DFS have in-order, pre-order and post-order traversal. Avoid the question with post-order only.</p>

2. Prepare a timer
   <br />
   Track the time to complete a task with a timer. It helps gauge the time needed to solve the question and understand the strengths and weaknesses.
   <br />
   <br />
  	You can start a timer to calculate the time you need to solve the problem. 
  	<br />
  	**OR**
	<br />
	You set a 30 ~ 45 minutes timer and try to solve the question within the time range.
3. Review the question and solution by the end of the day / next day
   <br />
   Constantly review and understand the solution help to improve your logic thinking and you might also discover some new and interesting solutions, yet effective.
   <br />
   By doing this also help you summarize and find the regularity or patterns.
   <br />
   **Things to review:**
   - Where do you stuck? 
     <br />
     It might because lack knowledge of using specific algorithms?
   - Why are you stuck?
     <br />
     It might be because of lack of understanding of the question or data structure?
   - How to improve the algorithms?
     <br />
     Maybe you are writing a brute force solution and perhaps can improve it?
   - How to better avoid bugs?
     <br />
     Do you have more than two submissions that failed not because of your answer but your syntax or wrong variable naming?
   - How to improve your coding style for better understanding?
     <br />
     Perhaps you should avoid using `a` and `b` as your variable name. You are not doing competitive programming but writing the code for your interviewer to understand.
4. Review the strength and weakness
   <br />
   After reviewing, you might gain some self-awareness about your strength and weakness.
   Write it down and checking back once in a while.
   <br />
   **Note:** Remember to review your strength as well because keep checking your weaknesses will de-motivate you.
   <br />
   (E.g., Solved the question within 20 minutes, write down what has been executed, though process, and how you did it)
5. **Read the review periodically**
   <br />
   It becomes meaningless if you never read back your review after writing them.
   Hence, it is very important to read the review on the next day, weekly, biweekly or monthly basis.
